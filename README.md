### Investigation Overview
  Objective: The primary goal is to build a classification model that accurately predicts whether it will rain based on the input weather conditions.
  Methodology: Dataset: The dataset file contains 6 columns with 2500 rows
  Data Processing: Clean and transform the data for machine learning models
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use suitable charts to uncover trends, correlations in the data.
  Model Development: Use classification models like logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest to build the model
  Model Evaluation: Use classification evaluation metrics to evaluate the model performance
  Report: Comment on the overall insight
